# Plant-Disease-Detection-System
# An AI Model build using Machine Learning algorithms and Computer vision providing accuracy of 96% (approx.), easily accessed using an interactive web-based application built on Streamlit.
ðŸª´This model was developed to detect various plant diseases accurately so that necessary treatments can be provided timely. Detecting these diseases promotes sustainable agriculture as appropriate treatments can decrease the use of harmful pesticides leading to decrease in food insecurity and increased yield percentage. 

ðŸª´Uses Tensorflow and Keras as machine learning libraries for obtaining CNN Architecture. 

ðŸª´Training accuracy of 99%  and validation accuracy of 96%

ðŸª´Trained with 10 epochs to powertrain for enchanced accuracy.

ðŸª´Heatmap and Classification report analysed to concentrate on each classes.

ðŸª´70479 files belonging to 38 classes for the training data and 17572 files belonging to 38 classes as testing data.

ðŸª´Utilizes CV2 library for image visualisation making it easier for increased efficiency and to focus on real-time detection and processing.

ðŸª´Using the activation function as relu ensures that the model understands complex patterns and relationships in data. 

ðŸª´Web-based interactive application deployed using Streamlit for simple yet efficient use by the users (Users= Farmers,Agriculturalists etc...) 

ðŸª´Real Time disease detection with less data utilization increasing the user interaction from rural areas with less internet connectivity.

ðŸª´Happy Planting :)
